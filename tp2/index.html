          It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of
          wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was
          the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of
          Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had
          everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct
          to Heaven, we were all going direct the other wayâ€”in short, the period
          was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities
          insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative
          degree of comparison only.
